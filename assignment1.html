                            <p class="card-text">Building a 3D printer is not necessarily as hard as it may sound! The printers come with a manual as well as snacks! The manual is detailed with pictures and text to help make the process as easy as possible. As you can tell from the first picture, my partner, Gil, and I laid out all of our materials before we started to stay organized and make sure we had everything we needed to build the printer (first picture). I learned that this is an often overlooked but very important step in assembly. After we were all set up, we went along through the manual and assembled the 3D printer. Along the way, we encountered some troubles. For example, we struggled with figuring out where to guide the LCD cable in the electronics box (second picture). The instructions were not very well labeled at this part and it would have been helpful if they provided a more zoomed out picture and multiple angles of where the LCD cable should go in the electronics box, as they only supplied one close-up picture of this. Our struggles with this are documented above, as well as our struggles with correctly supplying the filament into the PTFE tube (third picture). This process was very hard, and my partner and I realized that we had to properly screw in the tube all the way in. It was also very difficult to feed the filament through the tube. It would have been very useful if the manual had provided any common problems that users may have run into with solutions. What really worked from the manual was that its textual instructions were extremely well-written and thorough. I believe that I gained many skills such as being able to work simultaneously with materials and a manual, and I learned the intricacies of how a 3D printer works as well as all of the terminology relevant to a 3D printer. Finally, the last of the pictures shows the fully built 3D printer, and it came out great! Overall, the manual was very thorough, but lacked some extra photos which would have been useful for better understanding intricate parts of the assembly and lacked troubleshooting advice if the user ever ran into any problems with the installation. These are both things that I would add if I were writing the manual.

                                    <p class="card-text">As you can see, my Benchy (copper colored) did not come out nearly as well as expected. The idealized Benchy (last picture, in pink) is very smooth with no gaps or strings, whereas mine has many gaps and strings as well as a massive blob of filament where the smokestack of the ship was supposed to be (second picture). With my Benchy, my goal was to optimize the speed in which it could be printed. My settings are posted in the picture above my Benchy. Evidently, there are multiple things which I should change. Among these that is not present in the first picture is that my Benchy had 0% infill, leading to gaps in my Benchy. What I would change about my Prusa Slicer settings (first picture) to make my Benchy come out better (and not necessarily print faster) would be to decrease the layer height, as 0.3mm seemed to be much too thick for the nozzle. Another major flaw in my settings is that I had 2 solid top layers and 1 solid bottom layer. This low number of bottom layers created a very unstable and shifted base (third picture), coupled with the nozzle moving very quickly causing my print to actually shift over the course of the print. This is what led to my massive failure of a smokestack, the printer had no base for the chimney because it had shifted over time as the printer ran its course. The stringing was also caused by the printer moving too fast, which is a culmination of all of my settings. The lower number of top layers also added to the gaps in my Benchy. Finally, the low perimeter count created a thin outer layer lessening the structural integrity of the build. Overall, I would increase my infill percent to 10%, decrease the layer height to 0.3mm for the first layer and 0.2mm for the rest, add more bottom layers by increasing this number to 3 and add more perimeters by increasing this value to 3 as well. All of these changes would take more time to print, however the outcome would be a much sturdier and prettier Benchy which I am okay with sacrificing some time for!

                                    <p class="card-text">The main goal of this project was to go through the ENTIRE process required to 3D print a predetermined design. Starting off, we obtained our Prusa MINI+ Printers in their boxes and assembled the printers from scratch (first picture). Properly following the manual was a necessity and taught us valuable skills about the assembly process of complex machines. Despite the flaws of the manual (lack of pictures in some spots and no troubleshooting help) which were stated in greater detail above, the manual was very thorough and readable. For the most part, my partner and I were able to get along just fine from the manual alone. We completed the assembly of our 3D printer and fed a spool of a cool violet filament through the PTFE tube. The fully assembled printer with the filament spool can be seen in the second picture. Following our completion of assembling the printer, we moved on to the next objective of our project which was obtaining a 3D Benchy from online and optimizing it some way within Prusa Slicer (third picture). I chose to optimize my Benchy so that it would print as fast as possible. I lowered the amount of perimeters and infill, and increased the layer heights and shell thickness of my print settings. As a result, my Benchy did not come out as well as I had hoped (fourth picture), with major flaws in the sense that it had many gaps and stringy filament coating much of its exterior. Perhaps its biggest flaw was that due to the nozzle moving very quickly my Benchy was slowly shifting for each layer that was printed, such that by the time it came time to print the smokestack on top of the Benchy there was no designated area for it to go and it resulted in a big blob of filament on top of my Benchy! Lesson definitely learned! I will say despite all of these drawbacks in my Benchy, I learned the valuable lesson of how to troubleshoot when a print does not go as planned and am not better able to identify physical changes in the print with digital changes in the print settings. At least I learned how to shorten the time required to complete a print as well! Ultimately, going through the whole process of assembling the printer to downloading and changing my machines calibration settings to finally 3D printing my Benchy was a very rewarding experience! This was my first ever 3D printed piece, and I am excited for what the future holds! Stay tuned on my website for my next prints and much more!
