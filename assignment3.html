                            <h2 class="card-title">My First Soldered Circuit Board!</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">Welcome to Project 3! To start the soldering process on a blank circuit board (image 1) had quite the learning curve to it. Learning to control the soldering material with my left hand simultaneously with the soldering iron in my right hand was by far the most difficult process of the entire soldering (image 2). Initially, I created many bridges and left excess soldering material on my solder work, which was very frustrating because even the smallest sleight of hand could leave excess unwanted solder and create bridges (image 3). After soldering about half of the alarm clock’s circuit board I learned about the technique of keeping both the soldering tool and soldering material close together. Armed with this knowledge, I began to gain control of the soldering gun, as can be seen in the small dollops of solder material as opposed to large clumps (image 4). I was able to get those desirable little dollops of soldering material on each pinhole for about half of the board then my partner Johnny finished and we were both able to touch up the rest of our previous mistakes. Overall, for my first time soldering, I learned it quickly and am happy with my new skill that I have picked up. My first fully soldered board looks pleasing to the eye as well, with small evenly sized amounts of soldering material on each pinhole (image 5). After completing the soldering, we snipped the wires and our circuit board was completed (images 6 and 7)! Our display did not fully work at first, so we decided to troubleshoot this by checking our soldering. Evidently, there were two pinholes not fully soldered, so we added some material to them et voila! Our alarm clock was up and running (image 8)! It was then time to move on to measuring the dimensions of our clock for designing our alarm clock enclosure!

                                    <h2 class="card-title h4">Creating an Immiediate Enclosure for our Circuit Board!</h2>
                                    <p class="card-text">Surprisingly, there were many more measurements that we needed than I thought we would have to take. Each dimension (L, W, H) had different configurations of objects as this was not a symmetrical circuit board, so every single spacing had to be measured out in each direction. Before I delve any further, when I refer to an "immediate enclosure" I am talking about the enclosure in which we just place our alarm clock panel in, not the entire enclosure which may also be referred to as the "alarm clock" itself. For our first attempt at making an enclosure for our alarm clock, my partner and I started out by sketching a simple box that had the same dimensions as the alarm clock circuit board for length and width, with a tolerance value of 0.15mm. We obtained all of our measured values in our sketches via the digital calipers, which all of these dimensions can be seen in our sketches. For the height of the box, we were not sure where the battery would initially go, so the height that we used for the box was the maximum extrusion of the alarm clock circuit board plus the width of the battery, assuming we would lay it flat under the alarm clock’s circuit bed. We then took our sketch on paper (image 1) and translated it into a collaborative workspace on Autodesk Fusion 360. Due to the simplicity of the box, this was actually not too difficult of a task, we just had to adhere to the measurements of our circuit board and add a threshold of 0.15mm (image 2). We then exported our finished box design from fusion 360 into Prusa Slicer (image 3). We used default print settings for this box with a 15% infill. Finally, our first print was underway. The first print of the box went well and the alarm panel fits relatively well, but the offset was a little bit too large, so to get a tighter fit we needed to use a smaller offset for the next go around (image 4).

                                    <h2 class="card-title h4">The Front Face of our Alarm Clock Enclosure!</h2>
                                    <p class="card-text">Learning from our mistakes in the first print, we realized we needed to change the offset to 0.05mm. We also realized we did not need such an immense depth of our box so we created a much skinnier enclosure (including our panel face now) and decided to place our battery elsewhere (see ahead). We were able to do these quick fixes all on Fusion360 (image 1) and we were quickly underway to slicing again (image 2). We printed the second version of the immediate enclosure and the circuit panel fit into it amazingly this time (image 3)! For the evolution of the front face of our enclosure, we went with a threshold of 0.14mm between the face and the direct enclosure surrounding the circuit panel. We designed the face so that there were 3 large square holes on the front panel to display the time. We also created 3 smaller boxes at the bottom to allow for something skinny like a pencil to drop down and press the buttons to operate the alarm clock. We allowed space for the actual noise making device on the alarm circuit board to be heard better and uncovered. We first designed the face panel on paper (image 4) and then translated this into fusion 360 (image 5). We sliced in prusa (image 6) and had a first prototype done relatively quickly. The front panel fit really well over the alarm clock face and into the alarm clock enclosure, which was surprisingly reassuring (image 7). For the second go around, we decided that to access the buttons to operate the alarm clock we should add our own printed buttons onto the panel which could be inserted into the 3 smaller square holes in order to interact with the buttons on the circuit panel itself. These buttons were small and easy to design, and we created a slightly larger threshold value of 0.27mm in order to allow some room for the buttons to slide in and out of the face panel for ease of human interaction. For this next version, we also scratched the idea of the battery going directly behind the circuit board and had it go in a separate compartment behind the face panel via an extrusion. We figured both the 9 volt battery and the wires could fit in this new box. Lastly, we also added stoppers in this next version of the enclosure to keep the panel from sliding, as well as an extension on the upper left hand side to allow for the wires connecting to the batteries to flow out from the back of the panel into our battery compartment. We combined all of the above changes for the face panel and attached it to the immediate enclosure for the alarm clock circuit board. These new designs can all be seen incorporated in image 8. We did not print this part exclusively, we only added it to our face panel body design on fusion360 which would be a part of our final enclosure, as can be seen below. Our alarm clock was almost fully ready now!

                                    <h2 class="card-title h4">Finalizing our Alarm Clock: Igloo Enclosure!</h2>
                                    <p class="card-text">All that was left to design and print to finish up our alarm clock project was the main enclosure (as opposed to the immediate enclosure only around the circuit board). My partner and I decided to go with an igloo to house our alarm clock and its battery. My partner and I created a rough sketch of the initial thought process for this design (image 1), then took the sketch from the drawing board to Fusion360! First, we researched an igloo template and downloaded one from thangs.com. Once we had exported the igloo into Fusion360, we then carved into it our pre-existing alarm clock face panel with the battery holder and the alarm clock’s immediate enclosure. The final designed product is shown above (image 2)! We then took the igloo alarm clock to Prusa Slicer and we were ready to print! …or so we thought (image 3). Due to the wall thickness in some parts of the igloo being < 1mm, the slicer did not recognize a massive portion of the igloo and thus was unable to print it. We were able to fix this issue by right clicking on the igloo in Prusa and selecting the “Fix through the Netfabb” option. This repaired the thinness issue and thus made it possible for Prusa to recognize the existence of the walls. Finally, we were now able to print the igloo alarm clock (image 4, with supports: image 5)! We printed... and ran into yet another hurdle. About halfway through our igloo's first print, the filament in the spool got tangled and the printer stopped printing. Fortunately, the critical dimensions did print (the rectangular space to place our circuit board). Thus, we were still able to test out if our design was practical in the physical world, which is the most important part. We attempted to insert our circuit board and front face panel and sure enough, they fit! (Images 6 and 7) Our last step was to reprint the entire igloo enclosure, and cross our fingers that the filament would not get stuck again. After what seemed like days of waiting (realistically, only about 20 hours), our final, completed igloo alarm clock enclosure was fully printed and fully functional. The end product looks absolutely dazzling, as can be seen in images 8 and 9. One flaw in our overall project was that even after multiple attempts of getting our alarm clock to actually turn on, it did not turn on since the first day of soldering. We tried replacing the battery, checking the wires, checking the soldering, and even measuring the voltage of the battery. All seemed to be well, so my partner and I (as well as the professors) were quite stumped about this. Overall, a massive takeaway I got from the process of designing and printing an enclosure for an alarm clock circuit board is that a lot of measurements are required. These measurements need to be very precise, thus the need of the digital calipers. Additionally, patience is required especially when it comes to physical objects as we often encountered thresholds that were just not quite right or prints that were only slightly off such that the alarm clock panel may not fit right. The cumulative process from soldering the circuit board all the way to designing an alarm clock enclosure was a long and difficult project, but by far the most rewarding yet!
