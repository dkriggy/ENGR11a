                            <p class="card-text">To create a laser cut box for my alarm clock, first I had to create a schematic on paper. My original sketch used the dimensions of the alarm clock circuit itself, only with some little added wiggle room for tolerances. In image 1, my first sketch for my alarm clock enclosure with its initial dimensions are shown. Notice that each dimension includes the length of the alarm clock circuit board with added room for tolerances. Using this design, we then went to design it on fusion 360! Following the tutorial posted on LATTE for creating a laser-cut box with finger joints was not too difficult, but it was a time consuming process. I learned many things about parameters, constraints, mirroring, projections and joining on fusion 360. Speaking of parameters, image 2 shows my initial parameters of my box (the same as my sketched design). After completing the tutorial, this was my box! (image 3). Even though I was following along with someone building the box, I am quite proud that I was able to replicate it and I am happy with how it turned out. Before designing a face, I wanted to ensure that I had the correct dimensions for my box, so I decided it was time to prepare it for laser cutting!

                                    <p class="card-text"> Learning how to use reductive methods to create an object via laser cutting has been one of the most fascinating things I have learned over the course of this semester in engineering! In order to laser cut, many steps had to be taken first to prepare for this process. First, I had to lay out the pieces of my box flat. This process was much more difficult than I anticipated, mostly because I used the “joint” function which I had never before used. After some time figuring out the process of laying the pieces flat, I had my box fully laid out (image 1)! Another difficult process at first was exporting these pieces to LightBurn, our software to set up the pieces which were then to be laser cut on the particle board. After some initial struggling, I figured out that I needed to save and export each individual component of my box as a .DXF file and drop it into LightBurn. After doing this process for each piece, here is my set up in LightBurn (image 2)! I made sure to adjust my LightBurn settings such that the speed was at 20 mm/s and the maximum power output was at 100% power to ensure that my pieces were going to be cut with precision and power. These settings were originally flipped, and this would have likely caused a not thoroughly cut final product. All that was left to do now was to actually run the cut!

                                    <h2 class="card-title h4">Laser Cutting!</h2>
                                    <p class="card-text">The moment I had been waiting for had finally arrived! Watching the laser etch out my designs into plywood was a fascinating experience. I found it hard at times to keep my eyes not pried to the laser cutter (as the high frequencies of light can damage your eyesight for prolonged exposure), but it was just too captivating to watch it engrave the plywood (image 1)! After this engaging process concluded, I retrieved my pieces and assembled my box (images 2, 3, and 4)! The lessons I learned from my first laser cut box are threefold: First, the pieces fit together quite well and can stand on their own, but it is not too difficult to disassemble them as well. Second, I forgot to add spokes on both sides of the long end of my box so I was not able to fully assemble it. Third, by using the exact dimensions of the alarm clock circuit board, I completely forgot to take into consideration the thickness of the plywood as well as to allow space for the wires to flow out of the side of the circuit board, thus the circuit board was nowhere near fitting inside my box. Taking all of these lessons into consideration, I first redesigned my long pieces by adding spokes to both ends so that my box could be fully assembled. I then increased the parameters to account for adding twice the length of the thickness of the plywood as this was the distance which my box was lacking to allow for the circuit board to fit. I made these changes on fusion 360 and once again exported the files into LightBurn and was ready to laser cut again (images 5 and 6). Round 2 of cutting finished and I assembled the new box (fully this time!) (image 7) and much to my disappointment, the alarm clock circuit board still did not fit (image 8). I realized what I needed to do was increase the length of the box once again, as I had not been accounting for the full length of the circuit board as well as the added length of the wires when they are extruded from the side of the alarm clock’s circuit board. This proved to be a relatively painful process, as I was having issues when changing my parameters. Due to my many constraints, simply changing the length of the long side would disproportionately change the length of my tabs. This took a while to work out, as well as some manual inputting of values for lengths from my end, but eventually I was able to fix the issue. I finally added these changes, and all that was left to do was design a face. I used a relatively standard design where I added a face panel with holes to display the time, access the button interface, and for the speaker to emit sound. After incorporating all of these changes, my box was finally fully designed on fusion 360 (image 9)! I once again exported the sketches to LightBurn and used the same print settings as earlier (image 10). I then cut the pieces and in only a few minutes, my box was ready to be assembled! I assembled the box, and first tested out if there was enough room for the circuit board and the battery to fit, which there thankfully was (image 11). With crossed fingers, I then put in my alarm clock circuit board and snapped the face on top of it and sure enough they aligned! I had to tape some parts of the box as the pieces fit together, but it needed a little extra fortification to stay with the alarm clock pressing up inside. After all said and done, my laser cut alarm clock box was fully assembled (images 12 and 13)!

                                    <p class="card-text">Perhaps, what I am most satisfied with in this whole process are the lessons I learned along the way. It became apparent to me how painstaking the design process can be, especially when you know exactly what needs to be done in the physical world, but this can be very difficult in the digital world. Either the tolerances are not exact, the box pieces do not fit together perfectly, or the laser cut was not deep enough. I was subject to the frustrations that each of these scenarios come with, and was forced to digitally work through these issues, either in fusion 360 or in LightBurn. By being forced to work through fixing the little details in my box, I feel as if this project has added to my fusion skills more than any of the other tasks in the past. Additionally, I feel as if I can visualize how laser cut objects are created better than 3D printed objects as you can see the entire process occur from start to finish in a matter of minutes. LightBurn also adds to the ease of understanding laser cut designs, as it lays out what your cuts will look like flat out exactly as they come out on the board. Overall, laser cutting has been my favorite topic in engineering thus far and I cannot wait to work with it more!
