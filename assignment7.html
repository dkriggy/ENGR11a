                            <h2 class="card-title">Introduction and Needs Statement for Our Final Project!</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">   While we have had very successful meetings with Ryan Dailey, a high school teacher who helped create a softball arm as well as a golfing apparatus, as well as Boston Orthotics and Pediatrics, who said they loved our ideas, we were unable to find a client. As a result, we have decided to pivot to an open source project. Due to the fact that we do not have a client, we have decided to pivot from a very specific sport such as hockey or baseball, to a more general sporting activity; cycling. We will create an open source assistive device for those with an upper limb deficiency to be able to cycle. We created a needs statement for our new device we are going to create (with the help of AI technology): 



“Introduction:
This needs statement is crafted to address the requirements of a child in need of a prosthetic hand specifically designed with a sports attachment. The purpose is to provide the child with a functional and adaptable prosthetic solution that enables them to actively engage in various physical activities, fostering their overall physical and emotional well-being.

Purpose:
Children with upper limb differences face unique challenges in participating in physical activities due to the absence or limitations of a limb. Traditional prosthetic devices often lack the versatility and specialized features necessary to accommodate the dynamic movements required during sports and other physical endeavors. Hence, there arises a critical need for a prosthetic hand with a sports attachment tailored to meet the specific needs of these children.

Needs of the Child:
The child in question desires and requires a prosthetic hand equipped with a sports attachment to facilitate their involvement in a wide range of physical activities. The prosthetic solution should address the following needs:

1. Functional Adaptability: The prosthetic hand should offer adaptability and functionality suitable for various sports and physical activities, allowing the child to grip, manipulate, and handle different sports equipment securely.

2. Durability and Stability: It must exhibit durability and stability to withstand the rigors of active play and sports, ensuring reliable performance without compromising safety.

3. Customizability and Comfort: Personalization and comfort are essential for the child's acceptance and prolonged use of the prosthetic device, ensuring it fits securely and comfortably during active movements.

4. Ease of Use and Maintenance: The prosthetic hand should be intuitive to operate, requiring minimal maintenance, allowing the child to focus on the activity rather than the device's upkeep.

5. Adaptive Technology: Integration of adaptive technology that can evolve with the child's growth and skill development, providing ongoing support for their changing needs.

6. Psychological Support: The prosthetic hand should not only serve a functional purpose but also contribute positively to the child's self-esteem and confidence, promoting a sense of inclusion and normalcy in social and physical activities.

Conclusion:
In summary, there exists a critical need for a specialized prosthetic solution—a hand prosthesis with a sports attachment—to fulfill the unique requirements of children seeking to actively participate in various physical activities. This prosthetic device should not only empower them to engage in sports but also contribute significantly to their physical, emotional, and social development, fostering a sense of confidence, inclusivity, and independence.

This needs statement aims to emphasize the importance of developing prosthetic solutions that cater specifically to the needs of children, enabling them to embrace an active and fulfilling lifestyle without limitations”.


Based on this needs statement, it was then crucial to brainstorm features that our prosthetic attachment needed to address. We came to the conclusion that our prototypes must be durable, comfortable, and adaptable to multiple sports. Stemming from these ideals, success in this case would look like creating an attachment which accomplishes all of the above. We believe that this is very achievable, as we can use a more durable material with more infill to create a more durable prosthetic attachment. Additionally, we can design the attachment to have a snug, curved fit around the wrist in order to attain maximal comfort for the wearer. Finally, we can create an end attachment that is easily able to be adjusted and adapted to many different sports.

                                    <p class="card-text"> Now that we have thoroughly gone over our needs, it was time to start designing our prosthetic attachment! Our first prototype for a prosthetic device came from Dailey who gave us the files to create a golfing attachment. As a rough start, we first printed this in PLA just to get a feel for what we were working with. All of the pieces for this golf attachment are shown in image 1. Luckily, we learned a lot from this. Our goal from printing this was that it would have “Functional Adaptability”, “Ease of Use and Maintenance”, (as these two were drawn out in our needs statement) as well as it was easy to reproduce due to PLA being a cheap and accessible material. Immediately after testing the device for some time, we learned that PLA is not a great material to use for our purposes. It was not very durable such that our device could not withstand the force of our hands, as I was able to snap part of the hand attachment off with just my bare hands. Additionally, as can be seen in the above image, our attachment piece (used to attach the gauntlet to the actual mechanism which holds golf clubs) which is pictured above to be in the gauntlet, was completely shattered when we tried to dislodge it from its secured spot. While this is a good thing in the sense that once it is in it is hard to remove, we do not necessarily want this as a separation of the gauntlet and holding mechanism will be necessary at some point when actually using the product. One thing which we did very much like however was that the gauntlet was curved around our wrist, and not just two uncomfortable parallel lines. Even still, we had a lot to work on and improve.

                                    <p class="card-text"> For our next iteration, we wanted to hone in on a more specific sport, in order to get the best, most specific use out of our prosthetic device. So, we took our initial design and edited it so that the handle extruding from the gauntlet was not at a 45° angle to the gauntlet, but rather at a 90° angle to it, sticking out perpendicular to the gauntlet. This was all in mind of trying to create a device that could be optimized for someone who wants to bike who also has an upper limb deficiency. We designed it in fusion360, and printed it out (image 1)! Our result was overall a success, as we created an effective device where the attachment to the locking mechanism now protrudes at a right angle to the gauntlet. This device particularly adheres to the “Ease of Use and Maintenance” and “Psychological Support” ideals from our needs statement. We have laid the foundation for a device which can sit right on top of a bike handle where the child can quite conspicuously ride the bike, in terms of looks and function of a normal child, only furthering their self-esteem about their situation.

                                    <p class="card-text">For our third and fourth iterations, we changed an aspect of our design in both CAM and the materials which we used. First, we reprinted the attachment piece with many changes. Our first change was one related to CAM. Recalling our first attempt at printing the attachment piece, it was just too snug in our device. Thus, we scaled it in CAM to be 90% size and also lessened our infill to 50%. Our infill change was due to a recommendation by Ryan Dailey, who said he uses 50% infill when printing with NinjaFlex. That’s right, we decided to change the material of our attachment piece to NinjaFlex, and it made a world of difference (image 1). By allowing some tolerance for bending, and a slightly smaller piece, we had a much more pliable attachment piece. Another crucial plus side to this material change is that our attachment piece can now absorb the shocks and chatter of riding a bike much better than a PLA attachment device could due to the physical and chemical compositions of the two materials. Overall, this change is consistent with our “Durability and Stability” requirement from our needs statement, as the entire device rests on this one piece, thus we need it to stably attach the gauntlet to the locking mechanism to ensure the child’s safety. However, we were not done with changes here. In our fourth iteration, we again did a material change, also on a crucial piece of our device: the locking mechanism. We had decided to print it in the very expensive but durable material: Nylon! (image 2). We wanted something that could handle the trials and tribulations of an everyday child learning to ride a bike for the first time! Due to nylon’s impressive flexibility to strength ratio, as well as its UV resistance, we could not help but make it our obvious first choice of material to be used for our locking mechanism for the bike handle. This change was one of our most important, as it satisfied our “Durability and Stability”, “Functional Adaptability” and “Customizable and Comfort” requirements. We can see in the 3rd image above that we now had all of the pieces ready to go and to be assembled!

                                    <p class="card-text">Finally, we had some pieces to put together. Although once assembled, our device would not be fully complete (as we do not have a gauntlet to attach to at the moment), we still believed it would be very valuable to see how our fully put together locking mechanism would function. Taking all of our pieces, we attached some screws into them and assembled our locking mechanisms (nylon then PLA, respectively)! (images 1 and 2) We assembled the locking mechanisms for both the PLA and nylon iterations in order to compare the two side by side (image 3). The results were quite contrasting; the PLA locking mechanism was very loose and rickety, whereas the screws fit much more snugly into the nylon part with much less wiggle room. Overall, the nylon locking mechanism is much sturdier in material thus when assembled the parts move together smoothly as opposed to the PLA mechanism, which left much tolerance room for the parts to interact with each other. We need the parts to move together with little tolerances so that when the device is actually being used there is no worry that it will fall apart or that the clip may unexpectedly detach. Taking everything into consideration, the biggest changes among CAD, CAM, and material change were definitely the material changes. Creating our attachment piece made out of NinjaFlex was crucial to the connectivity of our gauntlet and locking mechanism. Additionally, changing our locking mechanism to be made from PLA to nylon was a complete game changer in terms of its sturdiness and the cohesiveness of the overall motions that the locking mechanism has to endure. That being said, we certainly learned the most from our initial PLA prototype, as it had by far the most flaws. From this, we learned that we need to change the angle of the gauntlet extrusion, as well as that PLA simply was not the material for us. Overall, we are very satisfied with how our progress has come along and are excited to see what our more finalized iterations look like in the near future! Stay tuned!
