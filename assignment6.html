                            <p class="card-text">Welcome to the beginning of the final project! For our final project, our tentative goal is to create an upper limb prosthetic device for children who are participating in sports. Our clientele is purposely broad as we want to be able to adapt a design for any particular child, likely from the age range of 6-14 years old, who plays any sport requiring the use of their upper limbs. Their weekdays mostly likely consist of going to school (either elementary or middle school), then playing their sport after the school day and finally going home after that. Weekends are likely to have one or two games per weekend, depending on the sport they play. We are absolutely open to finding a customer in many different places. We believe we are likely to have the client we are looking for through all of the elementary and middle schools in the area (sticking to Waltham, MA) for the time being. We have reached out to a multitude of different local schools, we reached out to Stanley Elementary School, MacArthur Elementary School, and James Fitzgerald Elementary School, all of which are in Waltham. Aside from this, we reached out to local hospitals such as Boston Children’s hospital or Boston Orthotics & Prosthetics. We emailed the entire contacts directory for Boston O&P thus far. We also believe that a good place to look for our clients would be through the Waltham youth sports leagues, even if these sports are not exactly likely for us to find clients, we figured that they may know someone who would be a good fit for us. We have emailed Waltham’s youth sports leagues for sports such as wrestling, basketball, and hockey, among many others. Essentially, any organization or person even remotely dealing with children or upper limb prostheses could be a good starting point for us.

                                    <p class="card-text"> Taking the above into consideration, we have drafted emails and have already sent out many emails to all of the places listed above. In our emails, we make sure to introduce our group members and our project goal. We then kindly ask all of the recipients of our emails if they have any children who they know which may be a good fit for us to help out! Our email template is relatively standard but differs slightly from organization to organization. An email template is shown above in image 1. After sending out these emails, we got a big hit through the e-NABLE hub with Ryan Dailey, a teacher at Hudson High School who helped create many prosthetic devices, for golfing and softball. Specifically, he gained some attention back in 2015 for creating a prosthetic softball device for a girl who did not have one of her hands (image 2). While we have not had a meeting with Ryan yet, we will be meeting with him on Thursday, 11-7-23. This meeting will be on zoom for about half an hour and will consist of us explaining our project and him helping us understand possible directions we can take it. The best case scenario for this meeting would be to come out of it with a client contact. To prepare for the meeting, we came up with a list of questions which we will ask at this meeting (image 3). Additionally, even though he may already be familiar with it, we are going to bring an e-NABLE hand to the meeting, as well as something he may be less familiar with: an e-NABLE hand’s palm printed with NinjaFlex (image 4). We tried printing with NinjaFlex and we are eager to hear his feedback about the potential advantages or disadvantages of printing with flexible filament.

                                    <p class="card-text">Despite us not having had our meeting with Ryan yet, my teammates; Natasha and Tristan, and I created an empathy map and a Feasibility vs. Impact graph for a potential client (images 1 and 2). These were both made with a general client in mind, regardless of what sport they play. They are both shown above. From the empathy map, we learned that we need to really take into account how the client may be feeling, likely that they want to be able to play their sports, have fun with their friends, and just to feel more included. From the Feasibility vs. Impact graph, we learned what designs were really important to focus on: Having an interchangeable grip adapter which would depend on the sport (hockey stick vs golf club vs softball bat, etc.) as well as wrists joints which are more flexible. This would depend on the sport, some would require a full 360° range of motion, or on the other hand joints that have a limited range of motion but in multiple directions. Since we have not yet met with a client, our problem for the time being is a general one: How can we best help a client with an upper limb deficiency who also wants to play a sport? In no particular order, we brainstormed the following 5 potential ways to aid our problem: Grippy lining, Flexible material, Interchangeable grip adapter, Interlocking joints, and the “Ball in coupler” mechanism for hand adapter. Now, my personal rankings with explanations for the ways to help a child in general who wants to be an athlete with an upper limb deficiency is as follows: 
                                    1. Interchangeable grip adapter - This is most important, as I believe that the option to be able to change grips based on what sport one plays is crucial, that way they can play any sport they want. 
                                    2. Interlocking joints - This is very important for flexibility of the hand, it simulates the way a wrist moves and on what particular axes the wrist moves.
                                    3.“Ball in coupler “ mechanism for hand adapter - Similar to the above regions, however this would allow for 360° degrees of motion, which is not necessarily what you want when dealing with some sports. This is still a very practical solution however.
                                    4. Grippy lining - Important, but not as necessary as the above. Still, it would be very nice to have a grippy lining on the adaptation in order to hold the sporting apparatus better.
                                    5. Flexible material - We are not sure if this will be useful yet, however we are investigating this is an option. We are only getting started from here! We are very excited to see where our meeting with Ryan will go and what further ideas we generate for our final project. I will be sure to keep this blog updated!
