                            <h2 class="card-title">Comparing Different Media Methods for Assembling a Prosthetic Hand!</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">To build the e-NABLE Phoenix Hand, my partner and I had to read through a written manual of the assembly as well as watch a video of the assembly (images 1 and 2). Upon watching both the video and reading a written manual of the assembly of the e-NABLE Phoenix Hand, it became apparent that they are each resources with strengths on their own, however no single resource would be sufficient to complete the project on its own. My partner and I found that the written manual was very helpful for assembling the hand itself. It was able to highlight the 3D-printed parts in different colors which made it very clear to decipher which object would go where. A drawback of the presentation was that there was no way to ensure that the actual method of your assembly was correct, you could only compare the final products. Additionally, there were 6 different kinds of pins, and only one of them looked very different from the rest. The other 5 types of pins all looked similar at a first glance, and the written manual did not give a clear way to distinguish between the 5 different types of pins, we had to visually inspect each pin in order to ensure that we were using the correct one during assembly. Additionally, the written manual was for the Phoenix Hand V2, whereas my partner and I were assembling the Phoenix Hand V3, so some parts didn't quite match up. Regardless, we were still able to fully assemble the hand properly from the written manual alone. If I were designing the process, I would ensure that each time a new version of the hand was released that I would create a new manual and link it with the new version of the hand. Overall, the written manual was effective for assembling just the mechanical components of the hand. In terms of enabling the hand to actually function through the stringing process, the video of the assembly was unbeaten. The stringing process was practically cryptic on the written manual, but it was extremely clearly displayed through the video. A drawback of the video for me is that it is slightly outdated, and it is a big effort to create a video for each new design change that comes out, whereas the manual can easily be updated. The video also clearly displayed the knot tying process. Thus, the video was much more effective to refer to if we were unsure if we were assembling the hand the proper way and to learn techniques for stringing and knot tying. The video is more of a teacher, and the written manual more of a quality check reference. Overall, if I were designing the manual process, I would refer the user to read the written manual through the assembly of the physical parts of the hand, then watch the video for the stringing and knot-tying processes. This way, it ensures that they are able to get the strengths of both types of manuals!

                                    <p class="card-text">As for the actual parts themselves, 3D printing them was not too much of a challenge, as I have become very familiar with how to 3D print at this point. First, I downloaded the files for the e-NABLE Phoenix Hand V3 from NIH.gov. These files included the arm guard, distals, left palm, proximal, snap pins with and without labels, tensioner pins and block, and a thermoforming piece. We scaled all of these pieces from 100% to 150% size in order to make the assembly of the hand easier. Upon doing so, we saw that there was no possible way that we could print all of the pieces on one Prusa mini printer. So, my partner and I decided to split up the printing. In total, it took 3 different prints to get all of the parts for the hand printed. The components of these 3 separate prints are shown above in images 1, 2, and 3. We printed all of the parts over the course of 2 days and they all came out great (image 4)!

                                    <h2 class="card-title h4">The Assembly of Our Prosthetic Hand!</h2>
                                    <p class="card-text">Now that all of our parts were fully printed, it was time to join them together to assemble a prosthetic hand! My partner and I followed the written manual for the fingers, hand, and wrist. First, we laid out all of the material to set up our working space (images 1 and 2). From there, we hopped right in to assembling the fingers. The biggest challenge with this was making sure we could match up each fingertip with its correct corresponding proximal phalanges, as they were not very well labeled. Once these were all fully assembled (image 3), we then attached each finger to the palm (image 4), which was a relatively straight forward process. Next, we had to heat up the arm guard in order to mold it so it could fit into the hand. We used a heat gun to get it to be pliable, then we attached it to the mold and allowed it to cool and harden into place (images 5 and 6). The arm guard was now ready to be attached to the rest of the hand with the wrist pins and wrist pin caps (image 7). We then had to attach the gripper box which slid into the arm guard easily. We also had to attach the thumb tensioner pins however we encountered an issue with the set of pins that we printed. One of our pins would not fit into the hole, and even after extensive filing of both the pin and the hole, we could not slim it down enough to work. Thus, we had to use a different set of pins and they worked great! The two different sets of pins are shown above, the red ones are the ones inserted in the hand that we ended up resorting to (image 8). We inserted the pins and screwed them in, allowing enough room for the pins to still be able to move. For the final post-processing details before stringing, we attached all of the dental bands to the joints as well as the Lee Tippi gel fingertips to all of the distals. We also had to attach the wrist straps to the arm guard piece in order to lock the prosthetic hand in place when the user wears it. Finally this took us to the end of our time with the written manual. My partner and I then transferred over to the video to follow along with the stringing process using the fishing line. As stringing was a very intensive task, we unfortunately did not document the process itself. Stringing was by far the most difficult portion of the entire assembly of the hand. It was very intricate and hard to follow along at first, however once we got the first set of strings down, the rest of the fingers were a bit easier to string. Tying knots with the string was also difficult, as the wire was very thin and it was hard to get a knot precisely where we wanted it. After a long fought battle with the stringing process, we were finally finished and our hand was ready to be used. Above are several images of the final product, post stringing! (images 9 and 10). One unfortunate flaw of my prosthetic hand is that I was not able to use it because my hand would not fit inside of the small wrist gap, meant for children. Even when I only tried to use several fingers, my efforts were of no avail (image 11). This was slightly unfortunate, because I really would like to know what it is like to use a prosthetic hand to do everyday tasks such as picking up a fork or brushing your teeth. Fortunately, the hand was able to flex, and I could live vicariously through my partner, who was actually able to fit his wrist and fingers into the prosthetic hand and even pick up a water bottle with it! (images 12 and 13). Thus, the prosthetic hand was a success! Overall, the assembly process of the prosthetic hand came with its challenges, mainly with labeling and stringing, but it was otherwise straightforward and a fun and easy process!

                                    <p class="card-text">To further add on to the design aspect of the e-NABLE Phoenix hand, I brainstormed a possible innovation to the hand with an added functionality: simply, a hole in the fingertip. This hole can be used for many different daily tasks. Some common ones which this might be useful for would be to insert a pen or a toothbrush into the hole. The brainstormed drawing is shown in the above image! It allows for a hole with a depth adequate enough to fully support the jerking motion one may have when brushing their teeth or writing with a pen. Overall, this design addition would not be too hard to integrate into the current model for the fingers, but would yield a significant functionality increase!
